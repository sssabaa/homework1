        <p1>Nakshi Kantha, or “decorated quilt” in Bengali, is a form of art that resembles simplicity. It doesn’t have any barrier to entry, other than dedication and love for the art itself. You start by selecting the fabrics, often reused from old saris or lungis. Then comes the magical part – sketching intricate designs onto the fabric and stitching vibrant threads. These designs frequently represent everyday events, elements of nature, or timeless symbols, with unique stories. Nakshi Kantha has served as a medium for women to convey their experiences, dreams, and aspirations.</p1>
